## Overview
NewsDaily is a sophisticated news aggregation and summarization platform designed to deliver personalized news articles directly to your dashboard. The platform utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Newspaper3k for news extraction and GPT-4 for article summarization. 

To further enhance the accuracy of the summarization, I explored the use of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. GANs generate synthetic news articles, providing a mixed testing ground for refining and adapting the GPT-4 to effectively handle a wide array of news content.

## Key Features
- **Automated News Pipeline**: The pipeline utilizes Newspaper3k for seamless, real-time extraction of news from a variety of reputable sources.
- **Article Summarization**: Leverages the power of GPT-4 API to produce concise and coherent summaries of articles, further enhanced by our research into **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for creating synthetic news articles. This research aids in refining our summarization capabilities, enabling the platform to deliver even more precise and contextually accurate summaries.
- **Contextual Search**: Incorporates Google Custom Search API to surface relevant web links related to the article, thereby enriching user engagement and broadening access to information.
- **Read On-Platform**: Offers users the convenience of reading entire articles directly on the platform, thereby negating the need to navigate away.


## Future Prospects
1. **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Plans to integrate analytics features that will present data on user behavior within their respective profiles.
2. **Bookmark Functionality**: Upcoming support for bookmarking articles for later reading.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: A recommendation system is in the pipeline to further tailor the user experience.
